# DnDice Roller

A Discord-bot for rolling dice. Choose your # of sides, # of dice, and whether or not you want the dice to explode (a mechanic found in many tabletop games).

## SETUP:
If you want to just upload this to your dev account and use it, here's what you'll need to do:

1. run npm install
2. create a "config.json" file and put your keys like so:  
{  
  "token": "[YOUR TOKEN]",
  "guildId": "[GUILD ID]",
  "clientId": "[CLIENT ID]"  
}
3. host it somewhere?
4. invite the bot to your server

## COMMANDS:
- "/roll [qty][sides][exploding?]":      Rolls your dice.



## INVITE LINK:
I have 24/7 hosting for now. If the bot is offline, I'm no longer hosting it:
